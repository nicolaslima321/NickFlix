# NickFlix API

## Overview

This project pretends to be an replica of **Netflix**, but instead of streaming videos, movies, it will stream musics clips, discographies. Filtered by genre, artist, and some other things..

It is an updated version of [my deprecated previous clone using PHP and Laravel](https://github.com/nicolaslima321-labs/old-nickflix-api). The application would be developed using TypeScript and NestJs
